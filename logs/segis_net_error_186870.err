Matplotlib created a temporary config/cache directory at /scratch/186870/matplotlib-h0_p_c9l because the default path (/cache/matplotlib) is not a writable directory; it is highly recommended to set the MPLCONFIGDIR environment variable to a writable directory, in particular to speed up the import of Matplotlib and to better support multiprocessing.
